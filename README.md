# Overview
This project uses **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate realistic **brain MRI images** containing synthetic tumor patterns.  
The aim is to create high-quality synthetic medical data that can be used to **enhance AI model training** for tumor detection, segmentation, and classification tasks.

By generating diverse and realistic tumor patterns, this approach addresses the problem of **limited annotated medical datasets** while ensuring data privacy.
